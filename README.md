This is part of a longer thing I'm doing, where I code an entire roguelike game using LibTCod. 
The main reason why I am coding this is to do something in python with a library I have never used, but more importantly to showcase my procedural generation algorithm. 
The algorithm uses the A* search algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to procedurally generate the map. 
Once the map is generated, the player..represented by an asterisk...can explore the map, lighting up areas they visit. The map is dark at first, except for a light around the player. 
There are two monsters coded into the map generation, but they dont do anything right now...and they were just a way for me to test a monster spawn system.
